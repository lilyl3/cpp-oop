# Snake and Ladder
Snake and Ladder is a classic turn-based board game played by two or more players on a grid, typically numbered from 1 to 100. Each player starts at cell 1 and takes turns rolling a dice to determine how many steps to move forward.

The game includes:
1. Ladders, which boost progress by instantly moving the player up to a higher cell
2. Snakes, which hinder progress by sliding the player down to a lower cell
The first player to land exactly on the final cell (e.g., cell 100) is declared the winner.

## Clarifying Requirements
1. What is the grid size? Board shape? 10x10
2. Are the positions of the ladders and snakes fixed or configurable? If configurable, what is the default?
3. Can a player overshoot the board and win?
4. Should the dice rolls be simulated by code or taken in as input?
5. Which player starts first?
